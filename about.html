        <P> Swimsuits are used to introduce babies and young children to the water and to build their in-water comfort and confidence. Made with buoyant foam, swimsuits help your little one stay afloat as they develop their swim skills in the pool. Recommended for beginning and first-time swimmers, most swimsuits can be worn alone or over a swim diaper if needed. </P>
        
        <H1> ABOUT OUR POOL TOYS</H1>
        <h4>our toys are made of nylon. Nylon stands up to water better than cotton or hemp rope. (Cotton and hemp are made of polymers, too, by the way, a polymer called cellulose.) Playing in the pool is always more fun with inflatable toys, made out of polyethylene and sometimes PVC.
        <p>Rules For All Pool Toys:</p>

         <p> 1. Check Toys Before Use – Check for holes, cracks, and even bugs when pulling out toys for the pool. Holes and cracks can cause leakage or sinkage and no one wants a spider in their pool noodle!

         This is an especially important rule for the beginning of the summer when you are pulling out your toys that have been stored away for the colder months. Lots of things can happen over the winter including damage, rust, and even animals nesting or hibernating… Just a quick but thorough once over can help you make sure your kid’s pool toys are in tip-top shape.</p>

         <p>2. Clean All Pool Toys – Like anything kids play with, it’s important to keep pool toys clean to prevent the spread of germs and bacteria. And while you may think your pool’s chlorine is enough – think again! It’s important to rinse off pool toys after use and clean them periodically to prevent slimy buildup and bacterial growth.

        Remember to take all pool toys out of the pool when you’re finished and keep them in a cool, dry place as well to prevent the growth of mold.</p>

         <p>3. Review Pool Safety Before Use – Before your kids are allowed to grab their favorite toy and hop in the deep end, remember to go over swim safety rules with them. Even if it seems like you have the same safety conversation every time you go to the pool, this is important. Repetition will help your kids commit these safety tips to memory.

         Remember, to make it a conversation, not a lecture. Ask your kids things like “Now what do we do if we hear thunder or see lightning?” or “What happens if someone has trouble treading water in the deep end?” and listen to their answer, correcting their mistakes and celebrating when they give the right answers.</p>
